<h1>resize</h1>
geometry will now fit a bounding box of size x,y,z with center of the old bounding box of the geometry
resize{x=1,y=1,z=1,geometry}

new bounding box can also receive exact coordinates to ignore the old center of the geometry
resize{x1=0,x2=1,y1=0,y2=1,z1=0,z2=1,geometry}

both notations can be mixed:
resize{x1=0,x2=1,z=1,geometry}
